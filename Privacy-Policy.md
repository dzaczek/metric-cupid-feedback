# Privacy Policy for MetricCupid
Last updated: January 11, 2026
MetricCupid ("the App") is developed by Jacek Zaleski. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.
1. Data Collection and Usage
We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.
The App is designed as a standalone client tool that connects directly from your device to your own monitoring services (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana, Icinga2).
Server Credentials: All server addresses, usernames, passwords, and API tokens you enter are stored securely on your local device using the macOS Keychain. They are never sent to us or any third-party servers.
Monitoring Data: The App fetches alerts and metrics directly from your configured servers. This data is displayed on your screen and is not collected, analyzed, or stored by the developer.
2. Network Connections
The App connects only to the server URLs you explicitly configure.
Direct Connection: All network requests are made directly from your Mac to your specified servers.
Security: By default, the App supports both HTTPS and HTTP connections to accommodate local intranet environments.
3. Analytics
The App does not use any third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics, Firebase, or Mixpanel) to track user behavior.
4. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the support page or repository issue tracker.
